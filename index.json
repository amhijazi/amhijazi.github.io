We consider a two-stage vaccination policy to approximate the current vaccine distribution schedule. Using the attack rate distribution from the simulation model, we formulate two-stage risk-neutral and risk-averse stochastic programs to minimize vaccination costs while ensuring a high likelihood of containing the disease below a desired attack rate threshold. We use sample average approximation to solve this model. The results demonstrate the cost savings and vaccine dose savings from using a two-stage stochastic program.
